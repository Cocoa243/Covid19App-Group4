                        The coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is safe and effective. It gives you the best protection against COVID-19. The Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines are currently available in the UK.
                      </p>
                      <h3> How safe is the COVID-19 vaccine? </h3>
                      <p>
                        The vaccines approved for use in the UK have met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Any COVID-19 vaccine that is approved must go through all the clinical trials and safety checks all other licensed medicines go through. The MHRA follows international standards of safety.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Other vaccines are being developed and they will only be available on the NHS once they have been thoroughly tested to make sure they are safe and effective.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So far, millions of people have been given a COVID-19 vaccine and reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions or clotting problems, have been very rare.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                    <p>
                      The COVID-19 vaccine is given as an injection into your upper arm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It's given as 2 doses. You will have the second dose 3 to 12 weeks after having the first dose. Both doses will be of the same vaccine.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Most side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine are mild and should not last longer than a week, such as:
                      <ul>
                        <li>a sore arm where the needle went in</li>
                        <li>feeling tired</li>
                        <li>a headache</li>
                        <li>feeling achy</li>
                        <li>feeling or being sick</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You can take painkillers, such as paracetamol, if you need to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You may get a high temperature or feel hot or shivery 1 or 2 days after having your vaccination. But if you have a high temperature that lasts longer than 2 days, a new, continuous cough or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste you may have COVID-19. Stay at home and get a test.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If your symptoms get worse or you are worried, please call 111.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <h4>Allergic reactions</h4>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Tell healthcare staff before you are vaccinated if you've ever had a serious allergic reaction. You should not have the COVID-19 vaccine if you have ever had a serious allergic reaction (including anaphylaxis) to:
                    <ul>
                      <li>a previous dose of the same vaccine</li>
                      <li>any of the ingredients in the vaccine</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Serious allergic reactions are rare. If you do have a reaction to the vaccine, it usually happens in minutes. Staff giving the vaccine are trained to deal with allergic reactions and treat them immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <h4>Reports of extremely rare blood clots</h4>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The MHRA is carrying out a detailed review of reports of an extremely rare blood clotting problem affecting a small number of people who have had the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The problem can also happen in people who have not been vaccinated and it's not yet clear why it affects some people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The COVID-19 vaccine can help stop you getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19. For people aged 40 or over and those with other health conditions, the benefits of being vaccinated with the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh any risk of clotting problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For people under 40 without other health conditions, it's currently advised that it's preferable to have another COVID-19 vaccine instead of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Call 111 immediately if you get any of these symptoms starting from around 4 days to 4 weeks after being vaccinated:
                      <ul>
                       <li>a severe headache that is not relieved with painkillers or is getting worse</li>
                      <li>a headache that feels worse when you lie down or bend over</li>
                        <li>a headache that's unusual for you and occurs with blurred vision, feeling or being sick, problems speaking, weakness, drowsiness or seizures (fits)</li>
                        <li>a rash that looks like small bruises or bleeding under the skin</li>
                        <li>shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling or persistent abdominal (tummy) pain</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h3>How effective is the COVID-19 vaccine?</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine should give you good protection from COVID-19 from 3 or 4 weeks after you've had it. However, you need to have the 2 doses of the vaccine to give you longer lasting protection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You can still get or spread COVID-19 even if you have the vaccine, therefore it is important to:
                      <ul>
                        <li>continue to follow social distancing guidance</li>
                        <li>if you can, wear something that covers your nose and mouth in places where it's hard to stay away from other people</li>
                      </ul>
